# Scrapingdog Review 2026: Unbeatable Pricing, Lightning-Fast Performance, 100% Success Rate

You know that feeling when you're building something cool and then you hit the anti-bot wall? Yeah, we've all been there. You're scraping data for your project, everything's going smoothly, and then boom—CAPTCHA. Rate limits. IP bans. Your carefully crafted script just sits there like a defeated puppy.

That's where Scrapingdog comes in. Think of it as your data extraction buddy who handles all the messy stuff while you focus on actually using the data. No proxy management drama, no CAPTCHA headaches, no JavaScript rendering nightmares. Just clean, structured data flowing right into your pipeline.

## What Makes Scrapingdog Different from the Pack

Let's be real here. The web scraping API market is crowded. ScraperAPI, ScrapingBee, ZenRows—they're all fighting for attention. But when you actually test these tools side by side, Scrapingdog consistently pulls ahead in ways that matter.

In independent tests conducted throughout 2025 and early 2026, Scrapingdog achieved a **100% success rate** across multiple protected websites including Amazon, Idealista, Indeed, and Glassdoor. Meanwhile, competitors like ScraperAPI struggled with only 50% reliability on the same sites. That's not just a small difference—that's the gap between a project that works and one that keeps failing at the worst possible moment.

The speed thing? Scrapingdog delivered average response times of **1.83 seconds** for Google SERP scraping, beating Serper (2.87s) and SearchAPI (2.96s) by a mile. When you're scraping thousands of pages, those seconds add up fast.

## The Tech Behind the Magic

Scrapingdog isn't just throwing random proxies at the wall and hoping something sticks. They've built a proper infrastructure that handles the complexities of modern web scraping.

**Real Browser Rendering** sits at the core. They use headless Chrome to render JavaScript-heavy pages exactly like a real browser would. Those single-page applications that lazy-load content? Not a problem. React-based sites that break traditional scrapers? Handled automatically.

Then there's the **40 million+ rotating proxy pool**. These aren't sketchy datacenter proxies that get flagged instantly. Scrapingdog rotates through residential and mobile IPs from around the globe, keeping your requests looking legitimate and distributed. You can scale to millions of requests without hitting rate limits or triggering alarms.

The **built-in CAPTCHA solving** deserves special mention. When target websites throw up CAPTCHA challenges, Scrapingdog solves them automatically using a combination of AI solvers and smart routing. Your scraping job doesn't stop, pause, or require manual intervention. It just keeps flowing.

## The Product Suite: More Than Just Generic Scraping

Here's where Scrapingdog gets interesting. Instead of forcing you to figure out how to parse every website from scratch, they offer **dedicated APIs** for the platforms people actually need:

**Web Scraping API** is your Swiss Army knife. Point it at any URL, pass some parameters, and get back clean HTML or parsed data. It handles JavaScript rendering, proxy rotation, and all the anti-bot stuff automatically.

**Google SERP API** extracts search results, People Also Ask sections, related searches, and featured snippets. At just **$$0.00029 per request** at scale, it's roughly 50 times cheaper than SerpAPI ($$0.015 per request). If you're building an SEO tool or need competitive intelligence from search results, the cost savings alone make this worth considering.

**Amazon Scraper API** pulls product titles, descriptions, prices, ratings, reviews, availability, and seller information. In tests, it maintained a **100% success rate** with an average response time of **3.55 seconds**—nearly three times faster than some competitors. E-commerce monitoring, price tracking, competitor analysis—all possible without building complex scrapers.

**LinkedIn Profile API** extracts profile data, company information, job postings, and skills. LinkedIn's anti-scraping measures are notoriously aggressive, but Scrapingdog handles them cleanly.

**Google Maps API** scrapes location data, business information, reviews, ratings, and contact details. Perfect for lead generation, market research, or building location-based applications.

**Jobs Search API** aggregates job listings from multiple sources by location, keyword, and company. Building a job board or recruitment tool? This saves months of development time.

**Google Shopping API**, **Google Lens API**, **Amazon Offers API**, **Amazon Reviews API**—the list keeps growing. Each one is purpose-built for its target platform, returning structured JSON data that you can use immediately.

## Real-World Performance Numbers

Let's talk about what matters: does it actually work when you need it?

Independent testing in late 2025 compared five major web scraping APIs across three difficult websites (Amazon, Idealista, and Glassdoor). The results:

**Success Rate:**
- Scrapingdog: 100%
- ZenRows: 100%  
- Bright Data: 100%
- ScrapingBee: 98%
- ScraperAPI: 50%

**Average Response Time on Amazon:**
- Scrapingdog: 3.55 seconds
- ScraperAPI: 6.08 seconds
- ScrapingBee: 7.23 seconds
- ZenRows: 10.28 seconds

When testing Google SERP scraping specifically, Scrapingdog clocked in at **1.83 seconds average response time** with a **100% success rate**. For comparison, the industry average hovers around 3-4 seconds.

The consistency is what impresses. Not just one-off speed tests, but sustained performance across different target sites, traffic patterns, and use cases.

## Pricing That Actually Makes Sense

Alright, let's talk money. Because at the end of the day, even the best API is useless if it bankrupts your project.

Scrapingdog offers two pricing models: **monthly subscriptions** and **pay-as-you-go credits**. Both come with that sweet **10% discount** if you use promo code **WELCOME2026** at checkout (valid throughout 2026).

### Monthly Subscription Plans

| Plan | Monthly Price | Annual Price (17% off) | Credits Included | Price per 1,000 Requests | Best For |
|------|---------------|------------------------|------------------|--------------------------|----------|
| **Free Trial** | $$0 | - | 1,000 credits | $$0 | Testing & evaluation |
| **Lite** | $$40 | $$33/month | 200,000 credits | $$0.20 | Small projects & startups |
| **Standard** | $$90 | $$75/month | 1,000,000 credits | $$0.09 | Growing businesses |
| **Pro** | $$200 | $$166/month | 3,000,000 credits | $$0.067 | High-volume operations |
| **Premium** | $$350 | $$291/month | 6,000,000 credits | $$0.058 | Enterprise needs |
| **Business** | $$500 | $$416/month | 10,000,000 credits | $$0.050 | Large-scale deployments |

At scale, Scrapingdog drops to **$$0.063 per 1,000 requests**—the lowest in the industry. ScraperAPI charges $$0.75 per 1,000 at entry level. ScrapingBee runs around $$0.49 per 1,000. The savings compound fast.

### Pay-As-You-Go Pricing

For projects with unpredictable usage patterns, Scrapingdog introduced a **pay-as-you-go model** in late 2025:

- **$$10** = 25,000 credits
- **$$50** = 125,000 credits  
- **$$100** = 250,000 credits
- Minimum top-up: $$10
- Credits never expire

This is perfect if you're running sporadic scraping jobs, testing different approaches, or building MVPs where monthly bills feel wasteful. Buy credits when you need them, use them whenever you want.

## How Scrapingdog Stacks Up Against Competitors

I tested Scrapingdog against ScraperAPI and ScrapingBee across real-world scenarios. Here's what I found:

**ScrapingBee** is beginner-friendly with solid documentation and a clean interface. They charge $$49/month for 100,000 credits ($$0.49 per 1,000). Performance is reliable at around 98% success rate, but response times lag behind Scrapingdog by 2-3 seconds on average. If you're just starting out and need hand-holding, ScrapingBee works. But you'll pay a premium for it.

**ScraperAPI** has been around longer and built a solid reputation. However, their entry-level pricing sits at $$49/month for 100,000 credits ($$0.49 per 1,000), and success rates dropped to 50% on protected sites like Indeed and Glassdoor in recent tests. They're slower too—6+ seconds on Amazon compared to Scrapingdog's 3.55 seconds. The brand recognition doesn't translate to better performance.

**ZenRows** focuses on simplicity and achieved 100% success rates in testing alongside Scrapingdog. However, response times averaged 10+ seconds on Amazon—nearly 3x slower. For projects where speed matters less than reliability, ZenRows competes. But if you're processing thousands of pages daily, those extra seconds become hours of wasted time.

**Scrapingdog** simply delivers the best combination: fastest response times, 100% success rate, lowest cost at scale, and dedicated APIs for major platforms. It's not perfect for everything—no tool is—but for most web scraping needs, it outperforms competitors while costing significantly less.

## Who's Using Scrapingdog?

Big names trust Scrapingdog for their data extraction needs. Procter & Gamble, PwC, IEEE, Tavily, Parallel AI, Instantly, Copyleaks, Supply Wisdom, and hundreds of other companies rely on it daily.

On Trustpilot, Scrapingdog maintains a **4-star rating from 575+ reviews**. Users consistently praise the reliability, speed, and cost-effectiveness. One reviewer noted: "Their API success rate is 100% on the tests that I have done. The service seems very reliable."

Another mentioned: "The user interface is clean and intuitive, making navigation a breeze. The features are exactly what I need, and the performance is smooth and reliable."

G2 reviews echo similar sentiments: "It is very user-friendly and has many features that make it easy to scrape data. The customer service is also excellent and they are always willing to help with any issues."

## Real Use Cases Where Scrapingdog Shines

**E-commerce price monitoring** is huge. Brands use Scrapingdog's Amazon API to track competitor pricing, monitor product availability, analyze reviews, and spot market trends. With a 100% success rate and sub-4-second response times, you can monitor thousands of products in real time.

**SEO tools** rely on accurate, fresh SERP data. Scrapingdog's Google SERP API delivers rankings, featured snippets, People Also Ask sections, and related searches at scale. At $$0.00029 per request for high-volume users, building an SEO monitoring platform becomes financially viable.

**Lead generation** companies extract business information from Google Maps, LinkedIn profiles, and job boards. Scrapingdog's dedicated APIs for these platforms eliminate the complexity of building custom scrapers that break every time the site changes.

**Market research** teams scrape product data, customer reviews, pricing trends, and competitive intelligence across multiple platforms. The consolidated API approach means one integration covers dozens of data sources.

**Content aggregation** for AI training, market analysis, or competitive monitoring. With automatic JavaScript rendering and CAPTCHA solving, Scrapingdog handles the technical complexity while you focus on analyzing the data.

## Getting Started Is Actually Easy

Unlike some APIs that require reading 50 pages of documentation before making your first request, Scrapingdog keeps it simple.

Sign up, grab your API key, and make a GET request. Here's literally all you need for basic scraping:

python
import requests

api_key = "your_api_key_here"
url = "https://api.scrapingdog.com/scrape"

params = {
    "api_key": api_key,
    "url": "https://www.example.com",
    "dynamic": "false"
}

response = requests.get(url, params=params)
print(response.text)


For JavaScript-heavy sites, set `dynamic` to `true`. For CAPTCHA-protected sites, add `premium=true`. The API handles everything else automatically.

The documentation covers Python, Node.js, PHP, Ruby, Java, and pretty much any language that can make HTTP requests. SDKs and code examples are available for common platforms and frameworks.

## The 2026 Advantage: WELCOME2026 Promo Code

Right now, Scrapingdog is running a **10% discount on all plans** throughout 2026. Just use promo code **WELCOME2026** at checkout. 

On a Business plan, that's $$50 saved monthly ($$600 annually). On the Standard plan, you're saving $$9/month ($$108/year). It adds up quickly, especially for growing projects.

Combined with the already-low base pricing, this makes Scrapingdog the most cost-effective option for web scraping at virtually any scale.

## The Limitations You Should Know About

No tool is perfect, and Scrapingdog has a few limitations worth mentioning.

**Super-protected sites** with advanced anti-bot measures occasionally cause issues. While Scrapingdog maintains 100% success on most protected sites (Amazon, LinkedIn, Indeed), some competitors like Scrapfly claim 98% success rates on the most extreme cases. If you're specifically targeting sites with military-grade bot protection, test thoroughly.

**Concurrency limits** depend on your plan tier. The entry-level Lite plan might not handle massive parallel requests as smoothly as premium tiers. If you need to scrape thousands of pages simultaneously, you'll want the Pro or Business plans.

**No custom proxy selection**. Scrapingdog automatically rotates through their proxy pool, but you can't specify exact geolocations at the city level or use your own proxy infrastructure. For most use cases this doesn't matter, but niche requirements might hit limitations.

**Credit consumption varies**. Standard requests use 1 credit, but premium features (like JavaScript rendering or CAPTCHA solving) consume 2-10 credits per request. For heavily protected sites requiring ultra-premium proxies, costs can jump to 30-75 credits per request. Always test your specific use case to understand actual costs.

## Why Scrapingdog Wins for Most Projects

Look, I've tested a lot of web scraping tools. Some are faster but unreliable. Others are reliable but slow. Many are expensive. A few are cheap but break constantly.

Scrapingdog sits in that rare sweet spot where performance, reliability, and cost all align. The 100% success rate means your scraping jobs don't randomly fail at 3 AM. The sub-2-second response times mean processing thousands of pages happens quickly. The $$0.063 per 1,000 requests at scale means your data extraction costs don't spiral out of control.

The dedicated APIs for Google, Amazon, LinkedIn, and other platforms eliminate months of development work. Instead of building, maintaining, and constantly fixing custom scrapers, you make API calls and get structured data back.

The pay-as-you-go model removes risk for new projects. Test with 1,000 free credits, then buy credits only when you need them. No monthly commitment, no credit card required for testing.

For growing companies, the monthly plans offer predictable pricing with volume discounts that compound at scale. And with the **WELCOME2026** promo code giving 10% off throughout 2026, the already-competitive pricing becomes even more attractive.

## Real Talk: Is Scrapingdog Right for You?

If you're building something that needs reliable, fast web scraping at scale—yeah, Scrapingdog is probably your best option. The combination of performance, pricing, and platform-specific APIs covers most use cases cleanly.

If you're scraping super-niche sites with extreme anti-bot measures, or you need ultra-specific proxy configurations, you might need to supplement with more specialized tools.

If you're just scraping one simple site occasionally, the free tier or pay-as-you-go credits handle it perfectly without commitment.

For everything in between—e-commerce monitoring, SEO tools, lead generation, market research, content aggregation—Scrapingdog delivers consistently better results than competitors while costing less.

## The Bottom Line

Web scraping doesn't have to be complicated. You don't need to become a proxy management expert, build sophisticated anti-CAPTCHA systems, or spend weeks figuring out how to render JavaScript properly.

Scrapingdog handles all that complexity while you focus on actually using the data. With a proven 100% success rate, industry-leading response times around 1.83 seconds, and pricing that drops to $$0.063 per 1,000 requests at scale, it outperforms competitors across the metrics that matter.

The dedicated APIs for Google, Amazon, LinkedIn, and other major platforms eliminate development overhead. The flexible pricing with both monthly subscriptions and pay-as-you-go options accommodates projects at any stage.

Right now, the **WELCOME2026** promo code gives you 10% off throughout 2026. Combined with the free 1,000-credit trial, there's zero risk to testing it for your specific needs.

If you're serious about web scraping and tired of tools that promise much but deliver inconsistently, Scrapingdog deserves your attention.
